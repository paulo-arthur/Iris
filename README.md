### This program can encrypt and decrypt images with a secret pixel order that contains a hidden message

### For example:
![pos](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49375534/102033049-33022000-3d99-11eb-9439-a8404298e726.png)
#### link for TXT file

#### Here we have an article from a Brazilian university with 462,849 characters
The major benefit of use this system is the security of encryption and the storage capacity
if you intend to send the image to someone via Discord or Whatsapp, remember to send the file itself, not the pop-up image
only PNG type works

An 1100x1100 image can contain 3,630,000 characters. This is enough to store an entire **Christian Bible**
